This Plugin allows you to access your WordPress sites only with the Whitelisted IP Addresses that you have allowed yourself.

== Description ==
In 2018, thousands of WordPress websites were hacked and millions were found at risk due to dozens of vulnerabilities as found by security researchers.

'Secure IP Logins' is the ultimate plugin to secure your WordPress website from unwanted or suspicious logins. Through secure login, only the IP addresses which are whitelisted can be used to access your WordPress site, unauthorized access is kept at bay and anyone found logging in via another IP (other than whitelisted ones) is banned - their IP address blacklisted even if he enter your credentials.

This process of Whitelisting IP Addresses and only allowing assigned dedicated IP addresses not only prevents your website from unwanted and suspicious logins but will ensure that your WordPress website gets the utmost security and privacy even in the case somebody gets hold of your website credentials.


== Installation ==
1. Upload "secure-ip-logins" folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Add whitelisted IPs by navigating to plugin page from wp admin navigation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can users access my website if they have the credentials? =
No. Even if the users have your website credentials, they won’t be able to access due to secure login WordPress plugin until or unless their IP addresses are whitelisted from within the admin panel of the plugin.

= If I haven’t Whitelisted any IP address, will I still be able to access my website? =
Yes. Until there is no whitelisted IP address, the plugin would not be activated because there are no IP addresses whitelisted yet which is why it is easily the best WordPress security plugin.

= How many IPs can I add in my Whitelisted IPs list? =
You can add up to 3 IPs in the Free version. However, you can upgrade your package to the premium version to add unlimited IP addresses in the plugin.

= Will this plugin secure my website from a brute force attack? =
In the brute force attack, the hacker tries various combinations of usernames and passwords to access your WordPress account unless it is cracked.
If you are using Secure IP Logins plugin, it will automatically block all attempts from any IP other than the whitelisted IPs.

= What if I lose those Dedicated IP Addresses from which I use to access the website? How will I then be able to get access to my website? =
